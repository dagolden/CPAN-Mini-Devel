NAME
    CPAN::Mini::Devel - Create CPAN::Mini mirror with developer releases

VERSION
    This documentation describes version 0.03.

SYNOPSIS
         $ minicpan -c CPAN::Mini::Devel

DESCRIPTION
    Normally, CPAN::Mini creates a minimal CPAN mirror with the latest
    version of each distribution, but excluding developer releases (those
    with an underscore in the version number, like 0.10_01).

    CPAN::Mini::Devel enhances CPAN::Mini to include the latest developer
    and non-developer release in the mirror. For example, if Foo-Bar-0.01,
    Foo-Bar-0.02, Foo-Bar-0.03_01 and Foo-Bar-0.03_02 are on CPAN, only
    Foo-Bar-0.02 and Foo-Bar 0.03_02 will be mirrored. This is particularly
    useful for creating a local mirror for smoke testing.

    Unauthorized releases will also be included if they resemble a
    distribution name already in the normal CPAN packages list.

    There may be errors retrieving very new modules if they are indexed but
    not yet synchronized on the mirror.

    CPAN::Mini::Devel also mirrors the "indices/find-ls.gz" file, which is
    used to identify developer releases.

USAGE
    See Mini::CPAN.
